The company’s first product, the D-EYE Retinal Screening System enables clinicians and organizations to perform mass health screenings and data collection to improve vital health examination services. Known as the “digital eye” into the state of the human body, the smartphone based D-EYE lens and on-board application allows anyone with minimal training to screen patients eyes for various health issues including Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy and Macular Degeneration; three serious pathologies causing blindness of millions of people annually.  The on-board D-EYE application creates a detailed patient record that can be shared instantly with other clinicians anywhere there is a cellular or internet connection.  Today, D-EYE is being used by Ophthalmologists, Emergency Physicians, Neurologists, Pediatricians, to name a few vertical specialists that perform ophthalmoscopies everyday. Combined with Apple TV, medical schools and other teaching institutions are using D-EYE to teach students and rotating Residents about the retina through both shared and self examination.  With the basic on-board D-EYE application development completed , new investment will be used to develop needed Hipaa compliant institutional integration processes and service based revenue product development initiatives that include: •	Development required gold standard field of view stitching algorithm, a breakthrough smartphone and cloud based system (Single fee based revenue service via the web)
•	Develop and utilizing existing machine learned artificial intelligence algorithms for initial assessment in the field (Revenue based on millions of exams)
•	Global revenue based digital telehealth services insuring specific pathologies are monitored reducing growing high incidence of blindness from catastrophic disease (Revenue based reader service provided by contract based Board Certified Ophthalmology MD’s)
•	Integration exam and reader services with global EHR systems providing (revenue based auto integration from 3rd party clinicians)
•	Data aggregation and mining processes to track various diseases on a global basis (Revenue based use of data subscription) With offices in Padova Italy and Truckee California, D-EYE has developed relationships with hundreds of clinicians and dozens of institutions in the US and the EU who are leading the protocol development to best utilize the D-EYE Retinal System to close the gap between serious eye disease and missed patient diagnosis causing preventable blindness for millions of patients who do not have easy and prescribed scheduled access to eye examinations on a regular basis. D-EYE sells both directly to clinicians and institutions and has developed global distribution relationships in countries around the word including many EU countries, UK, Canada, Middle East, Japan, South Africa with medical device registration in process in China, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. D-EYE received FDA clearance and CE mark in late 2015, and recently completed 2nd year ISO 13485, 13485 Canada and 9001 audits in June and July 2017. <a aria-disabled=""false"" aria-label=""Discover more apps in the Crunchbase Marketplace"" class=""cb-text-transform-upper mat-button mat-raised-button mat-accent _mat-animation-noopable"" color=""accent"" href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/marketplace/"" mat-button="""" mat-raised-button="""" rel=""noopener"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""mat-button-wrapper""> Unlock Marketplace Data </span><div class=""mat-button-ripple mat-ripple"" matripple=""""></div><div class=""mat-button-focus-overlay""></div></a> "

The Anesthesiology Refresher Course Lectures, the genesis of the Dannemiller Foundation's Anesthesiology Review Course, began in 1953 when Dr. Arthur B. Tarrow moved to prepare Air Force anesthesiologists for the board exams. In 1970, Dr. Joseph Dannemiller, their namesake, was informed that the Air Force could no longer continue supporting this event. Dr. Dannemiller then founded the Society of Air Force Anesthesiologists to ensure the continuation of this important educational meeting. The Dannemiller Memorial Educational Foundation was formed in his memory in 1984. In 2009, the company changed its name to Dannemiller, Inc. Dannemiller has grown to become a leader in continuing education and has been an accredited educational provider by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and California Board of Registered Nursing (CBRN) for 30 years. In the most recent survey by the ACCME, Dannemiller was awarded Accreditation with Commendation, the highest honor of accreditation by the ACCME, and their status as a provider was extended through 2019. In 2009, Dannemiller became accredited by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR). Dannemiller is comprised of: doctors (MDs, DOs, PhDs, and PharmDs), nurses (NPs, RNs, PhDs, & CRNAs), JDs, educators, instructional designers, continuing education accreditors, publishers, editors, meeting planners and coordinators, and a comprehensive IT and audio/visual support team. With roots in Anesthesiology and Pain Management, Dannemiller continues to expand its offering to a wide range of specialties in the medical and supporting communities. Although Dannemiller is widely known for its own continuing medical education (CME) activities, namely their Anesthesiology and Pain Review Courses, they also partner with other educational entities to provide credit for a combined total of more than 250 medical education programs and over 90,000 credit hours in a broad range of subject-matter each year. They are proud to offer these programs in a variety of educational modalities such as live, print, and interactive online formats. Program evaluations document that over 95% of Dannemiller CME activity participants learn something they will incorporate into their profession, meaning that they are hugely successful in producing positive results among activities intended to improve participants’ competence in their profession.

 Biotechnology  Clinical Trials  Therapeutics , European Union (EU) ,http://www.dcprime.nl/ https://www.linkedin.com/company/2003385 ,"DCPrime is a clinical-stage cancer immunotherapy company, which develops therapeutic vaccines based on its proprietary DCOne® platform. DCOne®‐based vaccines share all immune‐stimulatory properties with patient-derived dendritic cell‐based vaccines, and have the simple logistics of off‐the‐shelf products. In addition, DCOne® cells express a range of known tumor antigens, which are targets in several cancer types. A commercial scale manufacturing process to produce DCOne®‐based vaccines has been established and the company successfully completed a Phase I/IIa study in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) with its lead product DCP-001. DCPrime received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency for DCP-001 in AML. Based on the first promising results in patients with AML, DCPrime is now preparing an international multi-centre Phase II study in post-remission AML patients with DCP-001. DCPrime is also pursuing development of DCP-001 for another hematological cancer, Multiple Myeloma (MM). Pre-clinical work has begun evaluating the ability of immune cells from MM patients to be stimulated by DCP-001. In both AML and MM, the company will also explore combination therapies with existing treatments in preclinical studies. For further development of vaccines based on its DCOne® platform, DCPrime has established several procedures for loading of DCOne® cells with any cancer antigen. This is in preparation for creating a range of therapeutic products targeting several solid cancer types. The DCOne® platform and its lead product DCP-001 are designed to work in patients through the induction and expansion of anti-tumor T cells. Moreover they function as “off-the-shelf products”, in contrast to other T cell therapies and dendritic cell-based vaccines. <a aria-disabled=""false"" aria-label=""Discover more apps in the Crunchbase Marketplace"" class=""cb-text-transform-upper mat-button mat-raised-button mat-accent _mat-animation-noopable"" color=""accent"" href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/marketplace/"" mat-button="""" mat-raised-button="""" rel=""noopener"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""mat-button-wrapper""> Unlock Marketplace Data </span><div class=""mat-button-ripple mat-ripple"" matripple=""""></div><div class=""mat-button-focus-overlay""></div></a> "

In the following years became the developments of brands with their worldwide distribution rights more and more value. One of these brands is the EarNoiseEliminator. This medical laser is a great help and successful treatment against Tinntius and other inner ear deseases. The extraordinary thing is that this equipment can be applied from any person without knowledge. Under medical supervision and costsharing of health insurance companies did we made our first successful laser therapy in 1994. All the other developments and studies make it possible now, that we can offer this help by the laser therapy against tinnitus for a successful treatment at home. EarNoiseEliminator against Tinnitus - what should you do when it whistles, rings, roars or drones in your ear ? No one tinnitus is the same as another. How do I find out what treatment and what aid is right for me? Whoever suffers from tinnitus often loses the zest for life and hope for recovery. This does not have to be!   Our goal is to give you the best possible overview of the treatment possibilities for tinnitus and for similar inner ear disorders, such as partial deafness due to tinnitus, ear pressure, dizziness (morbus Ménière, vertigo), acute hearing loss and hearing distortion. In collaboration with affected persons and with specialists we are researching and developing new forms of therapy and evaluating their chances of success.  Results from a new study show that almost a quarter of the population has already experienced a ""ringing in the ears"" at one time or other. Almost 10% hear these sounds in their ears uninterruptedly for five minutes or longer. With 3% one can speak of chronic tinnitus. The earlier treatment begins, the greater the chances of a successful cure.  The most important and encouraging information is the fact that tinnitus has a benign cause in 99% of all cases. It can be regarded as a natural risk of modern living and a part of the aging process. In order to be certain about even the last percent, one should go to an ear, nose and throat specialist. If the diagnosis is benign then, medication or surgical treaments will have scarcely any effect here. Do not lose hope, however. We will try to advise you objectively and to inform you about the most promising of the treatment possibilities.  The EarNoiseEliminator can be used for the following applications:  • Ear pressure: 1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 6 weeks  • Acute hearing loss/hearing distortion: 1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12 weeks  • Dizziness:	1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 8 weeks  • Partial deafness due to tinnitus:	1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12 weeks  • Tinnitus:	1 x per day, 20 - 40 minutes, for at least 12 - 52 weeks  The following link shows how the EarNoiseEliminator is working : http://www.earnoiseeliminator.com/index.php?lang=en&inc=19 That link brings you to our Webshop : http://www.earnoiseeliminator.com/index.php?lang=en&inc=99 Also you get for free our Guide for the application of EarNoiseEliminator in addition to the therapies for sudden deafness - tinnitus - hearing loss - dizziness (vertigo) and pressure in  the ear.

The idea behind Dearbump was conceived in 2017, by two mums whilst discussing their pregnancies realised that whilst there are hundreds of products for babies, there was not much out there for us mums. Finding information and products for pregnancy is hard. We didn’t know where to look to find products when we were pregnant and there wasn’t much choice in supermarkets.
The idea was born. A monthly subscription box which can be delivered to mums to be throughout their pregnancy. Dearbump is somewhere you can go to find a range of products specific to pregnancy which have been tested and selected for your stage of pregnancy. Pregnancy is both exciting and worrying time, you want to give your baby the best start in life and ensure you do everything right, but it can be hard finding products which are safe for pregnancy.
We wanted to put together a package which allows parents to taking a little time out each month to make memories of their pregnancy and spend quality time bonding with their bumps. It’s something mums will remember when looking back on their pregnancies.  We conducted extensive research, to find and filter through the market to find the best products for pregnant women. Because caring for yourself is an important step in caring for your baby.
Dearbump provides products which have been chosen specifically for each month throughout pregnancy with advice and information and links to resources which some women might not otherwise have access to. Our boxes contain healthy snacks, pregnancy tea, beauty products, personal care products, and gifts and treats to pamper mums to be. <a aria-disabled=""false"" aria-label=""Unlock Charts on profile when you subscribe to Crunchbase Pro!"" class=""cb-text-transform-upper mat-button mat-raised-button mat-accent _mat-animation-noopable"" color=""accent"" mat-button="""" mat-raised-button="""" rel=""noopener"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""mat-button-wrapper""> Unlock Charts </span><div class=""mat-button-ripple mat-ripple"" matripple=""""></div><div class=""mat-button-focus-overlay""></div></a> "

And while the potential of Synthetic Biology is unquestioned, so are the challenges faced by researchers employing this science today. Artificial gene synthesis is a manual, trial-and-error process, requiring the correct combination of hundreds of unique variables for even the smallest genetic constructs. This iterative, hands-on approach often results in long and costly production cycles, hindering advancements and leaving much of this science's potential out of reach. We believe the key to overcoming these challenges, and truly advancing this field of research, lies in another of today’s groundbreaking technologies — Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence.
Here at DeepDiveBio, we are creating a next-generation synthetic biology platform through the development of novel, purpose-built instrumentation enabled by a world-class Machine Learning engine.

We provide various cosmetic restorative solutions, so that our patients can leave Smile By Design looking their best. From teeth whitening and makeover services to veneers and full mouth reconstructions, we offer multiple cosmetic services to meet individualized, patient-specific needs.
We strive to provide patients with personalized, affordable dental care, and that starts by offering special promotions to our valued patients. Get the most for your money by visiting our special offers page to learn more.
Dental implants are made to offer a base for replacement teeth that appear, feel and function like natural teeth. Patient’s that receive dental implants regain their ability to eat without discomfort, smile confidently and speak clearly. Although cutting-edge in nature, dental implants preserve more natural dentition than traditional bridgework, since implants do not utilize neighboring teeth for support.
The decision to straighten your teeth affects not only your smile, but your daily life as well. As an adult seeking orthodontic treatment, you may be hoping to enhance your smile for social or business reasons. Or, maybe you’re a teenager or the parent of a teenager searching for an effective, yet state-of-the-art solution. Whatever situation you may be in, Invisalign and Invisalign Teen can provide a simple solution to improve your smile without having to use traditional, metal braces. Learn more about the entire Invisalign treatment process by viewing our Invisalign product page.

 Medical , Greater Los Angeles Area  West Coast  Western US ,http://www.dentistrycentersofamerica.com/ ,"Because oral health is somewhat of a window into the state of overall health, DCOA offers an approach they call The Total Health Dental Group™. During the course of a regular dental exam, dentists are able to assist in the identification, diagnosis & treatment of other health conditions such as sleep apnea, diabetes, HPV/oral cancer, migraines, acid reflux, smoking cessation, diet & nutrition, etc. Other cosmetic procedures to further enhance one's appearance are also available, including teeth whitening & injectable dermal fillers like Botox, Restylane, etc. Through a Shared Services Center, DCOA centralizes all business aspects of each practice so clinical staff can focus solely on delivering an exceptional patient experience & care. The SSC leads back office functions like claims processing, purchasing, accounting, legal, IT, real estate/facilities, insurance, training & marketing with fewer staff & streamlined processes, enhancing efficiency & profitability. The initial step toward executing this plan is the acquisition, expansion & growth of 20 practices in 2016. Due diligence has already begun on practices that meet their desired criteria of at least $800,000 in annual revenues, six treatment rooms, dedicated staff, high-growth mode & healthy margins. Practices can be acquired for approximately 85% of annual collections & larger group practices like DCOA enjoy much higher net profit margins than traditional solo practices. By expanding days/hours, capturing specialty dental fees rather than referring those patients out, adding ancillary medical treatments and better marketing, DCOA will use its expertise in growing dental practices to grow revenues at a forecasted 1% per month as detailed in the Business Plan, while enhancing the bottom line performance through economies of scale. DCOA seeks $5 million in secured debt financing (incrementally among multiple parties or in a single transaction) as partial funds needed for the initial acquisitions. <a aria-disabled=""false"" aria-label=""Unlock Charts on profile when you subscribe to Crunchbase Pro!"" class=""cb-text-transform-upper mat-button mat-raised-button mat-accent _mat-animation-noopable"" color=""accent"" mat-button="""" mat-raised-button="""" rel=""noopener"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""mat-button-wrapper""> Unlock Charts </span><div class=""mat-button-ripple mat-ripple"" matripple=""""></div><div class=""mat-button-focus-overlay""></div></a> "

The spectrum of activities ranges from basic research to the development of new drugs for clinical trials, the promotion of networks and health services research. However, non-malignant haematological diseases, blood clotting disorders, laboratory analyzes, the whole range of supportive and palliative care for patients, care and ethical aspects also play a key role in the DGHO. In more than 20 theme-centered working groups, members are committed to advancing hematology and medical oncology.

 Information Technology  Medical Device ,,http://diagnoswiss.ch ,"DiagnoSwiss ambitions to become a recognised innovative force in life sciences. Their aim is to provide technical solutions for fast diagnosis and prognosis as well as for target proteins identification. To reach this aim, DiagnoSwiss currently develops two lines of products, namely: disposable polymer µ-chips and gel electrophoresis equipment for protein purification. In a second step of development, DiagnoSwiss will also merge these two products to develop a global solution for large-scale protein screening in proteomics. DiagnoSwiss’ core technology relies on protein analysis with microfabricated separation methods and affinity assays, and creates high-throughput proteomics platforms in the microtiter-plate format. DiagnoSwiss is filling the gap between high-throughput screening platforms and proteomics for advanced drug discovery. Mass production of low cost polymer micro-chips with specific surface treatment and ultra-fast electrophoretic purification of proteins in free flowing solution are the key elements of DiagnoSwiss’ innovating and proprietary technology. Their approach consists in maintaining the proteins in solution throughout the analysis of native biological samples, thereby increasing the separation rate, facilitating automation and optimising mass spectrometry identification. DiagnoSwiss is currently developing integrated protein analytical systems, that include components for fluid handling and coupling to high resolution detection means and that offer a unique alternative to 2D-gel electrophoresis. DiagnoSwiss’ micro-analytical systems will enable high-througput protein discovery, identification of protein structure and activity, as well as affinity testing (protein-protein, protein-small molecule interactions and immunological assays). Different architectures of miniaturized protein biochips will address the present requirements of proteomics-based drug discovery, and will be extended to the field of medical diagnostics. DiagnoSwiss develops new products and applications directly with its customers, and it aims at becoming a leading provider of instrumentation tools for biomarker discovery, protein assays and characterisation. Miniaturisation, automation, parallelism and its subsequent increased throughput provides order-of-magnitude or greater cost reductions and efficiency improvements on several levels.

Should you approach the end of the ideal time window to take your pill, the app will alert you on your phone until it has detected that a pill has been taken. If you still forget, Diem will give you advice on what to do next. Ultimately, Diem gives you the peace of mind that you are effectively taking your birth control pill. <a aria-disabled=""false"" aria-label=""Unlock Charts on profile when you subscribe to Crunchbase Pro!"" class=""cb-text-transform-upper mat-button mat-raised-button mat-accent _mat-animation-noopable"" color=""accent"" mat-button="""" mat-raised-button="""" rel=""noopener"" tabindex=""0"" target=""_blank""><span class=""mat-button-wrapper""> Unlock Charts </span><div class=""mat-button-ripple mat-ripple"" matripple=""""></div><div class=""mat-button-focus-overlay""></div></a> "

Based in Melbourne, Dimerix’s lead clinical program is a Phase 2 study in Chronic Kidney Disease, DMX-200. This study has repurposing of existing molecules at its core, and upon successful results from this study, Dimerix intends to pursue the pathway of registration of a product for an orphan indication. The study has been initiated at the Austin Hospital under the supervision of Professor Power, and is currently recruiting patients. The therapeutic rationale for DMX-200 was developed from Dimerix’s core patented technology, known as Receptor – Heteromer Investigation Technology (Receptor – HIT) which can be used to elucidate receptor interactions. Applying this technology to receptors such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR’s), Dimerix is able to identify differences in signaling behavior when receptors interact as heteromers, as expected in vivo, compared with the traditional analysis of single target receptors in isolation. In recent years Dimerix has been approached by several top 10 Pharmaceutical companies, and has assisted these with their drug discovery programs by applying the HIT technology and in house knowledge.

Headquartered in Berlin Adlershof, Germany, with a subsidiary in the Silicon Valley in California, we offer lasers with optical output power levels from a few hundred Watts up to the Kilowatt range, and with a beam parameter product of 7.5 mm.mrad even in the multi-kW range. The goal is to replace less efficient laser technologies by eliminating the need for a brightness-enhancing resonator.
Key to entering this competitive market is not only a diode laser system with unprecedented beam quality, but also an architecture that is designed with manufacturability in mind.

For starters, healthcare reimbursement is being tied to patient satisfaction and quality of care provided. Both patient satisfaction and quality of care provided is tied to the cultural competence of the providers, e.g. failing to connect with ethnically diverse patients or failing to properly assess their needs will result in less reimbursement for services rendered. In addition, women, minorities, and GLBT patients get inferior care in the US. Government studies clearly show that women, minorities, and people of color receive a lower quality of healthcare in the United States as compared to other people.
